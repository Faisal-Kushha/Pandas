  - [x] What is the average trip duration for a borrowed bicycle?
  - [x] What's the most common age of a bicycle-sharer?
  - [x] Given all the weather data here, find the average precipitation per month, and the median precipitation.
  - [x] What's the average number of bikes at a given bike station?
